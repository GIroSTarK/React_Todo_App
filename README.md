# React Todo App

React Todo App is a task management application that allows users to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app interacts with an API to store tasks persistently, ensuring data remains available across sessions. The UI is clean and responsive, providing a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React** for building the user interface  
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability  
- **SCSS** (Sass preprocessor) for styling  
- **REST API** for data storage and retrieval
